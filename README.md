## Abstract 

Adjuvant personalized cancer vaccines (PCV) targeting neoantigens are of increasing interest across malignancies. Herein, we report the results of a first-in-disease phase I clinical trial testing a PCV in women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), a low mutation burden tumor (NCT04024878). ‘NeoVax’ consisted of pools of synthetic long peptides admixed with the immunostimulant polyICLC, and was combined with anti-PD1 antibody for platinum-sensitive HGSOC following standard-of-care (SOC) platinum doublet chemotherapy. Vaccines were generated successfully for 10 patients, with >70% selected targets detectable by non-invasive cell-free DNA analysis despite prolonged prior exposure to SOC therapy. Clinical benefit was observed in 6 of 10 patients and was associated with broader immune responses. Multiple tumor- and vaccine-specific T cell clonotypes were detected in blood and tumor following vaccination. Importantly, tumor clones detected in resistant tumor lesions arose from diverse mechanisms affecting antigen presentation, indicative of immunoselective pressure imposed by vaccine treatment. Our results reveal an interplay between the breadth of antigens presented by the tumor and resulting immunity, which may dictate clinical efficacy following vaccination.
